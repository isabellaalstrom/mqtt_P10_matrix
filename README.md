# mqtt_P10_matrix
Modified PixelTime for use with mqtt

I have used this (driver)[https://github.com/2dom/P10_matrix] and modified the code to use mqtt to be able to print out messages from subscribed topic instead of weather. Improvements are coming, this is a first draft (and the first thing I've ever "written" for arduino).
